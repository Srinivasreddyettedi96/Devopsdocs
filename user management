Accountability becomes difficult when multiple developers are given root access with a shared password. If someone accidentally deletes a critical folder (like `/sbin`), your Linux server might crash, and you'll have no idea who caused it.

User Management ensures security, isolation, and auditability.

Here’s a quick overview:

👤 𝗨𝘀𝗲𝗿 𝗠𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁

Create a user: `useradd satya` (used in scripting)
Check users: `vim /etc/passwd`
Set a password: `passwd satya`
Verify password creation: `vim /etc/shadow`
Delete a user: `userdel satya`
Create a user with a home directory: `adduser satya`
List home dirs: `ls /home`
Confirms active user: whoami

⏳ 𝗣𝗮𝘀𝘀𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗱 𝗣𝗼𝗹𝗶𝗰𝗶𝗲𝘀

Expire password in 90 days: `chage -M 90 username`
Lock user: `passwd -l username`
Unlock user: `passwd -u username`

👥 𝗚𝗿𝗼𝘂𝗽𝘀

Create a group: `groupadd devops`
Check groups: `vim /etc/group`
Add user to group: `usermod -aG devops satya`

🔐 𝗦𝗦𝗛 𝗖𝗹𝗶𝗲𝗻𝘁 & 𝗔𝗰𝗰𝗲𝘀𝘀

Servers run `sshd` (secure shell daemon)
Clients use `ssh` to connect

Linux/macOS: `ssh satya@server-ip`
Windows (Git Bash): `ssh -i devops.pem ubuntu@server-ip`
Check instance details: `uname -a`
SSH config file: `/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/60-cloudimg-settings.conf`

Normal Mode: Can't write anything
Insert Mode: Can write content
Command Mode: Used for saving the data (Press ESC + :wq! saves the content and quits, :q! - won't save the file but can quit it)

𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗱𝘀:
Esc+0 --> goes to the first line
Esc+500 --> goes to 500th line
Esc+Shift+O --> will create a new line
Esc+U --> will remove the line
cat file.txt -->prints the content of file
less file.txt --> Opens the file to be viewed with scrolling support (sudo apt install less)
tail -20 file.txt --> Displays last 20 lines of the file
head -10 file.txt --> Displays first 10 lines of the file
tac file.txt --> Displays content in reverse order (like bottom to top order)
echo 'Hello' > file.txt --> Prints the message in file.txt but overrides the existing content
echo 'Hello' >> file.txt --> Prints the message in file.txt without overriding the content
